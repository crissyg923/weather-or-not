## Project Description

* [Link to Deployed Site](https://crissyg923.github.io/weather-or-not/)


 
This project was created to display the current weather as well as a five-day forecast, fulfilling the basic need of finding out current and future weather conditions.   

## Installation

Installing this project requires you to clone  the **weather-or-not**  repository to your local computer.  You can then edit the code and push your changes to the repo.   The steps involved are:

* Hit the **code** button in the repository’s homepage. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/crissyg923/weather-or-not)

* Clone the HTTPS code.

* Head to your machine’s local Terminal (for Mac) or Gitbash (for Windows).

Command into the directory where you want to park the repo.  It’s best practice to give the directory the same name as the repo.  Type the following command:

    git clone (paste HTTPS link from above)
    cd weather-or-not 

You will then need to create a feature branch so that your local changes can be reviewed before merging.  You can do that with the following command while in the repo in your terminal:

     git checkout -b feature/"new-branch-name"

Now you can edit the files in the **Markup Text Editor** of your choice.

When you are done, save your changes and push them to the repo using the following commands:

    git status (just to make sure you are still in the git repo)
    git add -A (to stage all changes)
    git commit -m “brief text description of changes”
    git push origin feature/"new-branch-name"

## Usage 

You can use this project as a basic guideline to create your own weather forecasting app or to simply study basic Javascriot coding skills.
